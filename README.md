We recently started to use [SASS / SCSS][1] to code our stylesheets. We were missing some proper syntax highlighting with the default CSS settings provided by [Notepad++][2]. After some research, we found a good base on [Wouter Beugelsdijk's techblog][3] but we were still not quite happy with it. 

# How to use

## To enable SCSS syntax highlighting:

*   In Notepad++, Go to the `Language` menu and select `User Defined Dialog...`
*   On the window that opens click on the `Import` button and select the XML file from this repository
* 	Restart Notepad++, select CSS sintax for your *.scss* files.
*   That's it, all your files with the *.scss* extension should now be highlighted

## To enable autocomplete:

*   go to your Notepad++ folder then to `/plugins/APIs/`
*   duplicate the `css.xml` and rename this file to `SCSS-Light.xml` or `SCSS-Dark.xml`

#Our modifications

## version 1.0

*   Highlighting for HTML tags
*   Changed some colors
*   Added syntax coloring for important comments starting with /\*! instead of just /\*
*   Added syntax coloring for partial css keywords used while using [nested properties][4]
